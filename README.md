This is a complete design for a hard disk based data logger and makes use of the PIC18 and ATA/IDE hard drive
models. The data logger software features a simple text based user interface which is accessed through the terminal. The hard drive data is stored into the file 'disk.bin'. The source code is written in PIC18 assembly language.
